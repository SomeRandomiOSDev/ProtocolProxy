/**
 A flag that determines whether or not this proxy will responds to optional
 selectors when there are registered observers but no implementer or an
 implementer that doesn't respond to the selector. The default value is @p NO.

 @discussion @p ProtocolProxy relies on a two main points when determining
 whether or not it responds to a given selector: whether or not the selector is
 declared as optional in the protocol, and whether or not the @p implementer (if
 any) responds to the selector.

 For required selectors, @p ProtocolProxy can easily say that it @a does respond
 to that selector, however, when the selector is optional @p ProtocolProxy has to
 fall back to consulting the @p implementer responds to the selector. If the @p
 implementer doesn't respond to the selector this could potentially cause an
 issue when observers expect that the given method will be called at some point.
 To remedy this one could set this flag to @p YES which would tell @p
 ProtocolProxy to return @p YES when asked whether or not is responds to a given
 selector.

 @warning A word of caution: although this resolves one issue, this could
 potentially cause unforseen issues as other code may make logical decisions
 based on whether or not this object responds to certain selectors. Additionally,
 when this is performed on selectors that have a return value, the bytes of the
 value returned to the calling code are always set to zero.
